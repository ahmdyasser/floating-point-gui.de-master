http://floating-point-gui.de aims to provide both short and simple 
answers to the common recurring questions of novice programmers
about floating-point numbers not "adding up" correctly, and
more in-depth information about how IEEE 754 floats work,
when and how to use them correctly, and what to use instead
when they are not appropriate.

The site is built using the nanoc static site generator:
